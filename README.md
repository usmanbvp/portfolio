# Deployment 🌐

### 1.Deploy on github pages 🚀

- Once you are done with your setup and have successfully completed all steps above, you need to put your website online!
- I highly recommend using to achieve this the EASIEST WAY.
- To deploy your website, you have two options. First you need to create a github repository with the name `<your-github-username>.github.io`. Please don't give it any other name.
- Now, by pushing the project files into your repository the website will be deployed.

Now, your website is successfully deployed and you can visit it at `<your-github-username>.github.io`.

### 2.Deploy on netlify 🚀

Netlify provides an excellent platform for hosting static websites with easy deployment.

- Visit Netlify's [official documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/) to learn how to deploy on Netlify.
